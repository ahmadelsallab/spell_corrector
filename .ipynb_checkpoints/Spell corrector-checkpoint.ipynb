    "We tackle the problem of OCR post processing. In OCR, we map the image form of the document into the text domain. This is done first using an CNN+LSTM+CTC model, in our case based on tesseract. Since this output maps only image to text, we need something on top to validate and correct language semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to build a language model, that takes the OCRed text and corrects it based on language knowledge. The langauge model could be:\n",
    "- Char level: the aim is to capture the word morphology. In which case it's like a spelling correction system.\n",
    "- Word level: the aim is to capture the sentence semnatics. But such systems suffer from the OOV problem.\n",
    "- Fusion: to capture semantics and morphology language rules. The output has to be at char level, to avoid the OOV. However, the input can be char, word or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fusion model target is to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "    p(char | char_context, word_context)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook we use seq2seq vanilla Keras implementation, adapted from the lstm_seq2seq example on Eng-Fra translation task. The adaptation involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapt to spelling correction, on char level\n",
    "- Pre-train on a noisy, medical sentences\n",
    "- Fine tune a residual, to correct the mistakes of tesseract \n",
    "- Limit the input and output sequence lengths\n",
    "- Enusre teacher forcing auto regressive model in the decoder\n",
    "- Limit the padding per batch (TODO)\n",
