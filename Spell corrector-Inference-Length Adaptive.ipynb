    "We tackle the problem of OCR post processing. In OCR, we map the image form of the document into the text domain. This is done first using an CNN+LSTM+CTC model, in our case based on tesseract. Since this output maps only image to text, we need something on top to validate and correct language semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to build a language model, that takes the OCRed text and corrects it based on language knowledge. The langauge model could be:\n",
    "- Char level: the aim is to capture the word morphology. In which case it's like a spelling correction system.\n",
    "- Word level: the aim is to capture the sentence semnatics. But such systems suffer from the OOV problem.\n",
    "- Fusion: to capture semantics and morphology language rules. The output has to be at char level, to avoid the OOV. However, the input can be char, word or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fusion model target is to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "    p(char | char_context, word_context)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook we use seq2seq vanilla Keras implementation, adapted from the lstm_seq2seq example on Eng-Fra translation task. The adaptation involves:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Pre-train on a noisy, medical sentences\n",
    "- Fine tune a residual, to correct the mistakes of tesseract \n",
    "- Limit the input and output sequence lengths\n",
    "- Enusre teacher forcing auto regressive model in the decoder\n",
    "- Limit the padding per batch\n",
    "- Learning rate schedule\n",
    "- Bi-directional LSTM Encoder\n",

Preoperative antibiotics were administered. A time-out was called to ensure the correct operative site and procedure and the tourniquet was inﬂated to 300 mmHg. The arthroscope was introduced along with a working portal. A diagnostic arthroscopy showed no chondral wear to the patella or trochlea. The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were without chondral Wear. There was a large positive drive-through sign of the medial joint. The mediai meniscus showed a superior peripheral tear that did not extend to the inferior articular surface. This was probed and felt to be overall stable. Lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau were without chondral wear and the lateral meniscus was probed and noted to be intact throughout. The ACL showed a proximal one-ﬁfth avulsion type injury with remnant footprint noted at the lateral wall of the notch. The PCL was probed and noted to be intact. Examination under anesthesia showed a grade II pivot shift with a grade 113 Lachman’s and grade III opening to valgus stress at 0 and 30 degrees.

The SutureTape limbs were passed through the looped end of the TightRope and then the loop was shortened drawing the ACL back onto the lateral wall of the notch. The limbs of the SutureTape and the FiberTape were passed through a transtibial tunnel that exited at the ACL footprint on the tibia. Attention was then turned to the MCL prior to final tightening of the ACL. A medial incision was made over the medial epicondyle with sharp dissection down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues and further dissection down to the medial epicondyle. A femoral avulsion type injury was noted of the MCL. A 4.75 min SwiveLock loaded with FiberTape was placed at the anatomic footpth of the MCL just proximal and posterior to the ' medial epicondyle. The pullout sutures were used to irnbricate the MCL and repair this with further imbrication more proximal through the periosteum. The FiberTape was tunneled along the length of the superﬁcial MCL distal and retrieved through a distal incision over the posterornedial tibia. The anatomic origin of the MCL was identiﬁed referencing of the courseof the pes tendons, which were palpated. After drilling and tapping, a 4.75 mm SwiveLock was used to secure the MCL after checking appropriate isometry through range of motion. The knee was held in 30 degrees of ﬂexion and neutral rotation and a Varus load while the internal brace was ﬁxed with a 4.75 mm SwiveLock distal. The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no block to motion. Additional #2 FiberWire sutures were used to imbricate the posterior oblique ligament and reattach this adjacent to the medial epicondyle. This was tightened in full extension: Finally, the Suture'l‘ape sutures were secured independent of the FiberTape sutures on the anterornedial tibia to finally secure the ACL in full extension. The arthroscope was introduced and the ACL was probed and felt to be Well positioned and re-approximated on the lateral wall of the notch. Lachman’s was noted to be restored. There was no pivoting and the knee was stable to applied valgus stress. There was no block to full range of motion. The incisions were then copiously irrigated and closed in layers.
