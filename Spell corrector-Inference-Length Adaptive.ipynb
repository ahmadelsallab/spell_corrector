    "We tackle the problem of OCR post processing. In OCR, we map the image form of the document into the text domain. This is done first using an CNN+LSTM+CTC model, in our case based on tesseract. Since this output maps only image to text, we need something on top to validate and correct language semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to build a language model, that takes the OCRed text and corrects it based on language knowledge. The langauge model could be:\n",
    "- Char level: the aim is to capture the word morphology. In which case it's like a spelling correction system.\n",
    "- Word level: the aim is to capture the sentence semnatics. But such systems suffer from the OOV problem.\n",
    "- Fusion: to capture semantics and morphology language rules. The output has to be at char level, to avoid the OOV. However, the input can be char, word or both.\n",

    "In this workbook we use seq2seq vanilla Keras implementation, adapted from the lstm_seq2seq example on Eng-Fra translation task. The adaptation involves:\n",

    "- Pre-train on a noisy, medical sentences\n",
    "- Fine tune a residual, to correct the mistakes of tesseract \n",

The limbs of the SutureTape and the FiberTape were passed through a transtibial tunnel that exited at the ACL footprint on the tibia. Attention was then turned to the MCL prior to final tightening of the ACL. A medial incision was made over the medial epicondyle with sharp dissection down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues and further dissection down to the medial epicondyle. A femoral avulsion type injury was noted of the MCL. A 4.75 min SwiveLock loaded with FiberTape was placed at the anatomic footpth of the MCL just proximal and posterior to the ' medial epicondyle. The pullout sutures were used to irnbricate the MCL and repair this with further imbrication more proximal through the periosteum. The FiberTape was tunneled along the length of the superﬁcial MCL distal and retrieved through a distal incision over the posterornedial tibia. The anatomic origin of the MCL was identiﬁed referencing of the courseof the pes tendons, which were palpated.

After drilling and tapping, a 4.75 mm SwiveLock was used to secure the ML after checking appropriate isometry through range of motion. The knee was held in 30 degrees of exion and neutral rotation and a Varus load while the internal brace was exed with a 4.75 mm SwiveLock distal. The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no block to motion. Additional #2 fiberware sutures were used to imbricate the posterior oblique ligament and reattach this adjacent to the medial epicondyle. This was tightened in full extension: Finally, the Suture'l‘ape sutures were secured independent of the FiberTape sutures on the anterornedial tibia to finally secure the ACL in full extension. The arthroscope was introduced and the ACL was probed and felt to be Well positioned and re-approximated on the lateral wall of the notch. Lachman’s was noted to be restored. There was no pivoting and the knee was stable to applied valgus stress. There was no block to full range of motion. The incisions were then copiously irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressings and a brace were applied. The patient was then awoken from general anesthesia and transferred to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition. \n"
