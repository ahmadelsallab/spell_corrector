 | I had a long discussion with today going over the MRI and discussing her ACL rupture and high grade MCL tear. I used a model to discuss the role of the ACL and MCL and we reviewed operative versus nonoperative management. At this point. based on her current symptoms and activity goals I feel that it would reasonable to proceed with AOL repair versus reconstruction as well as internal bracing of the MCL. We discussed various graft options and the associated risks with each and set-lied on a quadriceps tendon autograft in the case of a reconstruction. We discussed the frequent need for addressing associated meniscus tears and how this will be addressed at the time of surgery with either repair or debridement depending on the location and quality of the tear. We discussed the importance of working with physical therapy after surgery and i provided her with my postoperative rehabilitation protocol. After a thorough discussion of the potential risks. including but not limited to stiffness, neurovascular injury, infection, blood clots and failure of the reconstructed ACL, she has elected to proceed. She will be sent to MPO to have a post-op knee brace ﬁt for this ACL surgery to help support, stabilize, and protect the knee to prevent further injury and facilitate healing after surgery. The brace will also limit range of motion according to speciﬁcations. | I had a long discussion with today going over the MRI and discussing her ACL rupture and high grade MCL tear.

 | OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: The patient sustained a planting and twisting injury to her right knee and was noted to have instability through both the ACL and MCL. Given the proximal nature of the ACL tear, it was felt that early operative intervention with the potential for repair would be indicated; and therefore, an MCL repair would also be indicated at that time as apposed to delaying surgery. Risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives were discussed at length with the patient. She elected to proceed. | OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: The patient sustained a planting and twisting injury to her right knee and was noted to have instability through both the ACL and MCL.

 | PROCEDURE: The patient was identiﬁed in the preoperative holding area and the operative site was marked. The consent was again reviewed and all questions were answered. She was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthesia, and positioned supine on the operating table with the right lower extremity prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Preoperative antibiotics were administered. A time-out was called to ensure the correct operative site and procedure and the tourniquet was inﬂated to 300 mmHg. The arthroscope was introduced along with a working portal. A diagnostic arthroscopy showed no chondral wear to the patella or trochlea. The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were without chondral Wear. There was a large positive drive-through sign of the medial joint. The mediai meniscus showed a superior peripheral tear that did not extend to the inferior articular surface. This was probed and felt to be overall stable. Lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau were without chondral wear and the lateral meniscus was probed and noted to be intact throughout. The ACL showed a proximal one-ﬁfth avulsion type injury with remnant footprint noted at the lateral wall of the notch. The PCL was probed and noted to be intact. Examination under anesthesia showed a grade II pivot shift with a grade 113 Lachman’s and grade III opening to valgus stress at 0 and 30 degrees. There was a negative posterior drawer and asymmetric dial test. | PROCEDURE: The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area and the operative site was marked.
