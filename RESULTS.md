I had a long discussion with today going over the MRI and discussing her ACL rupture and high grade MCL tear. I used a model to discuss the role of the ACL and MCL and we reviewed operative versus nonoperative management. At this point. based on her current symptoms and activity goals I feel that it would reasonable to proceed with AOL repair versus reconstruction as well as internal bracing of the MCL. We discussed various graft options and the associated risks with each and set-lied on a quadriceps tendon autograft in the case of a reconstruction. We discussed the frequent need for addressing associated meniscus tears and how this will be addressed at the time of surgery with either repair or debridement depending on the location and quality of the tear. We discussed the importance of working with physical therapy after surgery and i provided her with my postoperative rehabilitation protocol. After a thorough discussion of the potential risks. including but not limited to stiffness, neurovascular injury, infection, blood clots and failure of the reconstructed ACL, she has elected to proceed. She will be sent to MPO to have a post-op knee brace ﬁt for this ACL surgery to help support, stabilize, and protect the knee to prevent further injury and facilitate healing after surgery. The brace will also limit range of motion according to speciﬁcations. |I had a long discussion with today going over the MRI and discussing her ACL rupture and high grade MCL tear.

OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: The patient sustained a planting and twisting injury to her right knee and was noted to have instability through both the ACL and MCL. Given the proximal nature of the ACL tear, it was felt that early operative intervention with the potential for repair would be indicated; and therefore, an MCL repair would also be indicated at that time as apposed to delaying surgery. Risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives were discussed at length with the patient. She elected to proceed. |OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: The patient sustained a planting and twisting injury to her right knee and was noted to have instability through both the ACL and MCL.

PROCEDURE: The patient was identiﬁed in the preoperative holding area and the operative site was marked. The consent was again reviewed and all questions were answered. She was taken to the operating room, placed under general anesthesia, and positioned supine on the operating table with the right lower extremity prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Preoperative antibiotics were administered. A time-out was called to ensure the correct operative site and procedure and the tourniquet was inﬂated to 300 mmHg. The arthroscope was introduced along with a working portal. A diagnostic arthroscopy showed no chondral wear to the patella or trochlea. The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were without chondral Wear. There was a large positive drive-through sign of the medial joint. The mediai meniscus showed a superior peripheral tear that did not extend to the inferior articular surface. This was probed and felt to be overall stable. Lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau were without chondral wear and the lateral meniscus was probed and noted to be intact throughout. The ACL showed a proximal one-ﬁfth avulsion type injury with remnant footprint noted at the lateral wall of the notch. The PCL was probed and noted to be intact. Examination under anesthesia showed a grade II pivot shift with a grade 113 Lachman’s and grade III opening to valgus stress at 0 and 30 degrees. There was a negative posterior drawer and asymmetric dial test. |PROCEDURE: The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area and the operative site was marked.

I believe that: a is doing quite Well at this time following a right knee ACL repair with right knee MCL repair. We did review precautions and once again reviewed her protocol which would include an additional week of toe touch weight bearing with the brace locked at zero. At three weeks post op, she may progress to weight bearing as tolerated with the brace locked at zero. I would like to see her back in 4 weeks for reassessment. We did review some home exercises to work on ROM. Based on quad set. which is actually quite good today with a mild effusion, i did not feet an aspiration was indicated. I did however recommend use of a Kneehab unit given her quad atrophy as I do not believe that physical therapy alone would be sufﬁcient to restore her quad strength. in addition, I did recommend use of conductive garment based on the area involved that does require multiple sites. She did agree to the plan and all her questions were answared. |I believe that is doing quite well at this time following a right knee ACL repair with right knee MCL repair.

FiberTape was drawn out through this lateral tunnel and ﬂipped along the far lateral cortex. The SutureTape limbs were passed through the looped end of the TightRope and then the loop was shortened drawing the ACL back onto the lateral wall of the notch. The limbs of the SutureTape and the FiberTape were passed through a transtibial tunnel that exited at the ACL footprint on the tibia. Attention was then turned to the MCL prior to final tightening of the ACL. A medial incision was made over the medial epicondyle with sharp dissection down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues and further dissection down to the medial epicondyle. A femoral avulsion type injury was noted of the MCL. A 4.75 min SwiveLock loaded with FiberTape was placed at the anatomic footpth of the MCL just proximal and posterior to the ' medial epicondyle. The pullout sutures were used to irnbricate the MCL and repair this with further imbrication more proximal through the periosteum. The FiberTape was tunneled along the length of the superﬁcial MCL distal and retrieved through a distal incision over the posterornedial tibia. The anatomic origin of the MCL was identiﬁed referencing of the courseof the pes tendons, which were palpated. After drilling and tapping, a 4.75 mm SwiveLock was used to secure the MCL after checking appropriate isometry through range of motion. The knee was held in 30 degrees of ﬂexion and neutral rotation and a Varus load while the internal brace was ﬁxed with a 4.75 mm SwiveLock distal. The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no block to motion. Additional #2 FiberWire sutures were used to imbricate the posterior oblique ligament and reattach this adjacent to the medial epicondyle. This was tightened in full extension: Finally, the Suture'l‘ape sutures were secured independent of the FiberTape sutures on the anterornedial tibia to finally secure the ACL in full extension. The arthroscope was introduced and the ACL was probed and felt to be Well positioned and re-approximated on the lateral wall of the notch. Lachman’s was noted to be restored. There was no pivoting and the knee was stable to applied valgus stress. There was no block to full range of motion. The incisions were then copiously irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressings and a brace were applied. The patient was then awoken from general anesthesia and transferred to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition. |FiberTape was drawn out through this lateral tunnel and flipped along the far lateral cortex.

PROCEDURE DETAILS: Patient was brought to the Operating Theater and, following smooth induction of general anesthesia, was prepped and draped with the left knee prepped free. Standard arthroscopic portals were made along the inferior, medial, and lateral joint line along with a superior lateral egress portal for the arthroscopic pump. Moving into the suprapatellar pouch, the patient's patellofemoral joint really was very well—preserved. There wore no artiCular cartilage degenerative changes or injury. Sequential exam was then carried out involving the medial and lateral gutters. The scope was then moved into the lateral compartment. Lateral femoral condyle and tibia were pristine. The lateral meniscus was probed from anterior to posterior horn and found to be stable throughout. ACL and PCL were intact, and the scope was then moved medially. Here, there was a comminuted bucket—handle tear that was not repairable. A corresponding partial meniscectomy was performed, removing the posterior horn and mid body, leaving only the anterior third fully intact. There were no operative complications. Sponge and needle count was correct x2. |PROCEDURE DETAILS: Patient was brought to the Operating Theater and, following smooth induction of general anesthesia, was prepped and draped with the left knee prepped free.
