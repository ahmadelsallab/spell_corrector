 | I had a long discussion with today going over the MRI and discussing her ACL rupture and high grade MCL tear. I used a model to discuss the role of the ACL and MCL and we reviewed operative versus nonoperative management. At this point. based on her current symptoms and activity goals I feel that it would reasonable to proceed with AOL repair versus reconstruction as well as internal bracing of the MCL. We discussed various graft options and the associated risks with each and set-lied on a quadriceps tendon autograft in the case of a reconstruction. We discussed the frequent need for addressing associated meniscus tears and how this will be addressed at the time of surgery with either repair or debridement depending on the location and quality of the tear. We discussed the importance of working with physical therapy after surgery and i provided her with my postoperative rehabilitation protocol. After a thorough discussion of the potential risks. including but not limited to stiffness, neurovascular injury, infection, blood clots and failure of the reconstructed ACL, she has elected to proceed. She will be sent to MPO to have a post-op knee brace ﬁt for this ACL surgery to help support, stabilize, and protect the knee to prevent further injury and facilitate healing after surgery. The brace will also limit range of motion according to speciﬁcations. | I had a long discussion with today going over the MRI and discussing her ACL rupture and high grade MCL tear.
